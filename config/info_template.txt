I'm keeping track of a sequence of numbers!

## How To Use
- Write a number in sequence to **continue the count**
- If you write the wrong number, the counter will reset
- You can use **Python** mathematical symbols: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**` (power), `()`
- The result is always **rounded** to the nearest whole number
- You can't count immediately after yourself, you need to wait for someone else to continue before you can count again
- You can use some math constants: **π** ≈ **3.14159**, **ϕ** ≈ **1.61803**

## Public Commands
`/info` - Show information about the bot
`/next` - Show the next number in the sequence
`/leaderboard` - Display Top {leaderboard_count} users by the correct count, incorrect count, ect…
`/stats` - Show user statistics

## Restricted Commands
`/switch channel` - Change bot's operating channel to another
`/blacklist add` - Add user to the blacklist
`/blacklist remove` - Remove user from the blacklist
